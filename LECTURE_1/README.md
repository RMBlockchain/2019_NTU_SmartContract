# NTU Smart Contract Course Code and Slides

This is the repository for 2019 Spring Course on Ethereum Smart Contracts Applications in National Taiwan University offered by Prof. Pecu Tsai and partly lectured by Samuel (Yen-Chi) Chen

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In this lecture, you need to install the following: flask npm vue bootstrap-vue

#### Front-End

```
npm install 
```

#### Back-End

```
pip install flask
```
```
pip install pymongo
```

### Installing

You need a free mongoDB account in order to use the backend.
Once you get the database link, make sure to add a file at
`BackEnd/constants/authInfo.py` as the following:

```python
mongoDB_Auth = "mongodb://YOUR_DB_LINK"
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
